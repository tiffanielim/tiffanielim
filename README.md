## Hi there! I'm Tiffanie, welcome to my GitHub :)

ðŸ”­  I'm currently at the Snap Academies, and transferring to USC this fall! <br />
ðŸŒ±  Looking for a Summer 2025 internship. <br />

ðŸ˜„  Pronouns: she/her <br />
âš¡  Fun fact: I'm a huge foodie, and I love talking about different food spots. [My favorite eats in LA](https://tiffanielim.github.io/favLAEats/)<br />
ðŸŒ®  My favorites right now are either Pasta e Pasta by Allegro (Japanese fusion pasta) or Avenue 26 Tacos, both in the LA Arts District!
